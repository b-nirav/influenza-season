# About
In this repository, I conduct an in-depth analysis to create a staffing plan for the influenza season in the United States. During this period, the incidence of flu cases rises significantly. This analysis is designed to help a medical staffing agency prepare for the influenza season by studying historical trends, enabling them to proactively manage staffing requirements across the country.
