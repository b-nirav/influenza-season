# About
In this repository, I perform a thorough analysis to provide a staffing plan for influenza season in the United States. The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. This analysis aims to assist a medical staffing agency in planning for influenza season by examining historical trends to proactively address staffing needs across the U.S.
