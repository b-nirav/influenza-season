# About
In this repository, I conduct an in-depth analysis to create a staffing plan for the influenza season in the United States. During this period, the incidence of flu cases rises significantly. This analysis is designed to help a medical staffing agency prepare for the influenza season by studying historical trends, enabling them to proactively manage staffing requirements across the country. 

## Tableau Storyboard

## Dataset
The following data sets covering influenza in the United States will be used during the project:
1. [Influenza Deaths by Geography](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx)
2. [Population Data by Geography, Time, Age, and Gender](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)

The influenza deaths dataset comes from Center for Desease Control(CDC) and population data is from US Census Bureau. 
### Census Data
The dataset is likely representative of the population due to various data collection methods. However, some county population data is missing for certain years, which limits aggregation and yearly state-wise comparisons. Additionally, the annual data collection process creates a gap between survey and publication, potentially introducing errors. Manual data entry could also cause inaccuracies. Nonetheless, since the data is from a government agency, it is likely to have minimal errors and is the best available source for this analysis.
### CDC Influenza Deaths Data
Puerto Rico data is missing, so we can't accurately describe flu-related deaths there. Some data is suppressed for privacy, meaning not all influenza deaths are included. The analysis results will only apply to 2018, as the data spans 2009-2017, and may not be relevant for the current year. Despite these limitations, this is the most accurate dataset available for our analysis.
