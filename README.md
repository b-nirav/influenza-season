# About
In this repository, I conduct an in-depth analysis to create a staffing plan for the influenza season in the United States. During this period, the incidence of flu cases rises significantly. This analysis is designed to help a medical staffing agency prepare for the influenza season by studying historical trends, enabling them to proactively manage staffing requirements across the country.

## Dataset
The following data sets covering influenza in the United States will be used during the project:
1. [Influenza Deaths by Geography](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx)
2. [Population Data by Geography, Time, Age, and Gender](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv)
